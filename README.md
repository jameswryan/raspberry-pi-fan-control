This is a project I worked on with my younger brother.
We threw the code together in an afternoon at the same time we designed the fan control circuit.

When I have time, I'd like to flesh this out a bit more, or at least point towards some better utilities to control a Raspberry PI fan.


To install
	
run `make` to compile

use `watch fan &` in the program directory to run every few seconds in the background
